This is a Stata package that plots distributions of variables after absorbing the variance from fixed effects (i.e. categorical controls) and linear covariates.

The package can be installed by executing in Stata:
```
net install fedistr, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leojahrens/fedistr/master") replace
```

Once installed, please see `help fedistr` for the syntax and the whole range of options.
